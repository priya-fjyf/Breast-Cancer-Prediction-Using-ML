# ðŸ§¬ Breast Cancer Prediction (ML Classification)

This project uses **Machine Learning** techniques to predict whether a tumor is **malignant (cancerous)** or **benign (non-cancerous)** based on diagnostic features of cell nuclei from breast mass images.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **Dataset**: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)  
- **Source**: Kaggle
- **Total Instances**: 569  
- **Features**:  
  - Radius, Texture, Perimeter, Area, Smoothness, Compactness, Concavity, etc.  
- **Target Variable**:  
  - Diagnosis: `M` = Malignant, `B` = Benign

scikit-learn

## ðŸ“ˆ Output / Results

### âœ… Model Accuracy:
- Logistic Regression: **96.5%**
- Random Forest: **97.2%**
- SVM: **96.8%**
- KNN: **95.4%**

> âœ… **Best Performing Model:** Random Forest (Based on Accuracy & Confusion Matrix)

### ðŸ“Š Visualizations:
- Correlation Heatmap of Features
- Count Plot of Malignant vs Benign Tumors
- Distribution Plots of Key Features (Radius, Texture, Area)
- Confusion Matrix for Model Comparison

###  ðŸ“Œ Key Insights:
- Malignant tumors tend to have higher mean radius, perimeter, and area.
- High correlation found between radius_mean, perimeter_mean, and area_mean.
- Random Forest provided the most balanced and accurate predictions.
